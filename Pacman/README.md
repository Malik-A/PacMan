# PacMan
## Javascript Exercise
This project was created as a javascript exercise to learn how to control the DOM. When viewing this file in a browser a user should see an image of "pacman" moving back and forth across the screen. Users can view the html file and adjust the images used if desired. Users can also download the javascript file and update the timeout counter to change the duration and update how often pacman moves across the screen.
